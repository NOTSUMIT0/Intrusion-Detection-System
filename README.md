## 1) Introduction to Intrusion Detection Systems

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security mechanism designed to monitor network or system activities for malicious actions or policy violations. IDS plays a critical role in cybersecurity by identifying potential attacks, misuse, or abnormal behavior in real time or through offline analysis.

IDS solutions are broadly classified into:

- **Signature-Based IDS** — Detects known attack patterns using predefined rules
- **Anomaly-Based IDS** — Detects deviations from normal behavior using ML models
- **Hybrid IDS** — Combines both approaches for better accuracy

> This project implements a **Hybrid IDS** with a custom web dashboard, real-time WebSocket alerts, and contextual MITRE ATT&CK intelligence.

---

## 2) Project Overview

This project is a **Hybrid Intrusion Detection System** with a SIEM-style, multi-page web dashboard. It is capable of:

- Analyzing real network traffic and detecting threats
- Mapping them to **MITRE ATT&CK** tactics and techniques
- Pushing real-time alerts via **WebSockets** to a custom HTML/JS frontend
- Visualizing alerts with actionable security intelligence using **ECharts**

The system supports:

-  **Offline packet analysis** on Windows using PCAP files
-  **Real-time live packet capture** on Linux (via Scapy)
-  **Test mode** for development using mock packets
-  **Centralized alert storage** and multi-page visualization dashboard

---

## 3) Objectives

- Detect network-based attacks using signature and anomaly-based techniques
- Provide real-time and offline traffic analysis
- Map detected attacks to the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework
- Present alerts through a user-friendly, SOC-style multi-page dashboard
- Push real-time alerts to the frontend using **WebSockets**
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows and Linux)

---

## 5) What's New

> These features were added in the latest version compared to the original project.

###  Fully Custom Web Frontend (Replacing Streamlit)
The old Streamlit dashboard has been **completely replaced** with a custom, multi-page web application built using:
- **HTML + Tailwind CSS** for a sleek dark-theme SOC-style UI
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for dynamic, live-updating content
- **Apache ECharts** for rich, interactive charts

###  WebSocket Real-Time Alerts
The FastAPI backend now supports a **WebSocket endpoint** (`/ws/alerts`) that pushes new alerts instantly to all connected dashboard clients — no polling or page refresh required.

###  Multi-Page Dashboard (5 Pages)
| Page | Description |
|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | Overview with metric cards, MITRE kill chain, charts, incident grouping, and alert table |
| **Alerts** | Dedicated filterable alert feed |
| **Analytics** | Deep-dive charts: severity distribution, attack types, alert timeline, top source IPs, and analytical insights |
| **MITRE ATT&CK** | Kill chain overview, technique frequency, severity-by-tactic chart, and technique list |
| **About** | Project info page |

###  Alert Details Modal
Each alert row in the dashboard opens a **detailed modal** showing:
- Attack name, severity, type, MITRE technique
- Source IP / Port, Destination IP / Port
- Traffic metadata: packet size, rate, byte rate, TCP flags, flow duration

###  Export to CSV and PDF
From the dashboard, you can export the entire alert list as:
- **CSV** — for spreadsheet/SIEM import
- **PDF** — generated client-side using **jsPDF**

###  MITRE ATT&CK Kill Chain Visualization
The dashboard now renders a **live kill chain** based on detected alerts, showing which ATT&CK tactics have been triggered. Each tile is clickable and opens a **Tactic Deep Dive** panel with technique descriptions, impact analysis, risk level, and mitigation steps.

###  Active Incidents Grouping
Alerts on the dashboard are now **grouped by source IP** in an "Active Incidents" section, giving a quick attacker-centric view.

```

---

## 7) Data Flow and Processing

1. Network traffic is captured (PCAP file, live packets, or mock test packets)
2. Packets are parsed and converted into flow features by the **Traffic Analyzer**
3. **Detection Engine** evaluates traffic using:
   - Signature rules (JSON rule set)
   - Anomaly detection model (Isolation Forest)
4. **Alert System** generates structured alerts with full metadata:
   - Timestamp, attack name, severity, MITRE technique
   - Source/destination IP and port
   - Packet size, rate, TCP flags, flow duration
5. Alerts are logged locally and **HTTP-POSTed** to the FastAPI backend
6. Backend stores the alert and **broadcasts it via WebSocket** to all connected dashboard clients
7. Dashboard receives the alert and dynamically updates charts, tables, and metric cards

---

## 8) Detection Techniques Used

### 1. Signature-Based Detection
- SYN Flood detection (TCP SYN flag analysis)
- Port Scanning detection
- Pattern matching based on TCP flags, packet rate, and packet size
- Rules defined in `data/signatures/signature_rules.json`

### 2. Anomaly-Based Detection
- Machine learning model: **Isolation Forest** (scikit-learn)

## 11) How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- pip
- Node.js + npm (for Tailwind CSS build)
- Wireshark + Npcap (for Windows PCAP mode)

### Step 1 — Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2 — Build Tailwind CSS (frontend styles)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

> This compiles `assets/css/styles.css` → `public/output.css` used by all dashboard pages.

---

## 12) Running on Windows (PCAP-Based Analysis)

### 1. Capture traffic using Wireshark

Save the capture file as:

```
data/pcaps/sample.pcap
```

### 2. Start the FastAPI backend

```bash
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload
```

The API will be available at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### 3. Run the IDS in PCAP mode

Open a new terminal, then run from the project root (`e:\Project Programs\IDS`):

```bash
cd src
python main.py
```

> By default, `main.py` runs in **PCAP mode** reading `data/pcaps/sample.pcap`.

### 4. Open the Dashboard in your browser

Open this file directly in your browser:

```
frontend/pages/dashboard.html
```

Or navigate using the sidebar to: Alerts, Analytics, MITRE ATT&CK, About.

---

###  Test Mode (Windows — no PCAP file needed)

To run IDS with **mock packets** for development/testing, edit `src/main.py` and switch:

```python
# Comment this block:
# ids = IntrusionDetectionSystem(mode="pcap")
# ids.run_pcap_mode(pcap_path)

# Uncomment this block:
ids = IntrusionDetectionSystem(mode="test")
ids.run_test_mode()
```

Then run:

```bash
cd src
python main.py
```

---

## 13) Running on Linux (Live Packet Capture)

### 1. Install required system tools

```bash
sudo apt install tcpdump
```

### 2. Start the FastAPI backend

```bash
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload
```

### 3. Run the IDS in Live mode (requires root)

Edit `src/main.py` to enable live mode:

```python
ids = IntrusionDetectionSystem(mode="live")
ids.run_live_mode()
```

Then run:

```bash
cd src
sudo python main.py
```

> The IDS will now analyze live network traffic in real time.

### 4. Open the Dashboard

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
frontend/pages/dashboard.html
```

> The dashboard connects to the FastAPI WebSocket at `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws/alerts` for real-time updates.
